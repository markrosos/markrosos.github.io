<p>I’ve been meaning to make this post for weeks now, and it’s been so long that I don’t even remember which documentation I was supposed to write about reading. Probably Jekyll, since I had so much trouble getting it up and running. The documentation on the github was completely wrong, likely due to the recent changes to the ability to launch a Jekyll theme from the github site itself. The other five random “help” blogs I read didn’t help much either. Only the documentation on the Jekyll site itself</p>
